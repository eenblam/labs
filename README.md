# Labs
This repository contains a series of Linux networking labs
to be run from your own computer.

## Goals
- Make the Internet infrastructure you use feel more accessible to you.
- Provide free and open training materials for those who are relatively new to networking.

## Requirements
All you need, for now, are Vagrant and Virtualbox.

Python and Ansible might also be required as more labs are developed.

## Existing Labs
- [01: Web Server Woes](01_web_server_woes/)
- [02: Gateway](02_gateway/)

## Wishlist
Feel free to open an issue (or a PR!) if there's content you want to see here.
Current work is tracked [via kanban](https://github.com/eenblam/labs/projects/1).

I'm not sure how easy layer 2 labs will be to design,
since both Vagrant+Virtualbox and Docker have limitations around
what their virtual network drivers will support.

## Inspiration
Here are some projects that inspired this one.
While their formats differ from this one, they're similar in spirit.
